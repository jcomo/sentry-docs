The Release Details page focuses on an individual release. Elements of the release are presented in visual trends for crashes and sessions, specifics regarding each issue, and commit author breakdowns.

Hover over specific dates and times in the overview graph for a quick perspective of events that crashed, behaved abnormally, errored, or are healthy, as defined for [Release Health](/product/releases/health/). The graph also displays markers showing adoption stage changes when you view a time period where that is applicable (and you've filtered by a single environment).

<Note>

The adoption stage feature is available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.
